Project Title: Restaurant App

Description/Motivation: The is my final project for MIT coding bootcamp. It is an application that list some fake restaurants and a few of their dishes, which you can order from. 

Installation Guidelines: Clone files. Open root file in terminal. Enter npm install. When done installing, enter npm run dev. Split the terminal and move into backend file. Enter npm install. When done installing, enter npm run build. When done building, enter npm run develop. Navigate in browser to localhost:3000.

Technology used: Next.js, Strapi, Stripe, Docker, Apollo and GraphQL.

Features: Some improvements I would like to make are: Adding other ways to login, displaying who is logged in, updating the home page, and giving each restaurant a page.
